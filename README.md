RSA Factoring Challenge

**RSA** ( **Rivest–Shamir–Adleman** ) is a [public-key cryptosystem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography "Public-key cryptography") that is widely used for secure data transmission. It is also one of the oldest. The [acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym "Acronym") "RSA" comes from the surnames of [Ron Rivest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Rivest "Ron Rivest"), [Adi Shamir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shamir "Adi Shamir") and [Leonard Adleman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonard_Adleman "Leonard Adleman"), who publicly described the algorithm in 1977. An equivalent system was developed secretly in 1973 at [GCHQ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_Communications_Headquarters "Government Communications Headquarters") (the British [signals intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signals_intelligence "Signals intelligence") agency) by the English mathematician [Clifford Cocks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Cocks "Clifford Cocks"). That system was [declassified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_information "Classified information") in 1997.^[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem%29#cite_note-1)^
